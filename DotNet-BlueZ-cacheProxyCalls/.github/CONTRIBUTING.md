## Testing changes

At this time there is only a manual test to exercise most of the functionality of the library.

### Testing Tips

If you don't have a known good BLE device that's easy to use for testing, consider installing the LightBlue app on mobile app ([iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/lightblue/id557428110) or [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.punchthrough.lightblueexplorer&hl=en_US&gl=US)). You can create a virtual device like a Polar HR Sensor in the app. Then use the manual test to connect to the virtual device and read GATT characteristics.
